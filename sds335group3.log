+nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

+This implies I have a file 'jl_noadd txt' that is unknown to the remote and not on the stage. This only exists in my working directory. I can add the file to the stage via git add.

+I have used git before for my research project. My first experience with git is Gitlab and I have also used svn, which is old version of git. I'm using Gitlab thesedays and I really love git functionalities. It is a lot easier to work coding together as a team. Also I can see all of codes, changes, history, and even publish issues via website.

+I sometimes have some merge conflict and I remembered I struggled a lot when I commited changes into my branch (not master) and one of my team mate pushed changes on the same file. When I tried to pull his changes, I got bunch of merge conflicts and I had to resolve the issue and commit again. I was just a bit nervous because I didn't want to mess up other codes. After taking this lecture, I feel much more comfortable resolving merge conflicts.
