+I have used git before for my research project. My first experience with git is Gitlab and I have also used svn, which is old version of git. I'm using Gitlab thesedays and I really love git functionalities. It is a lot easier to work coding together as a team. Also I can see all of codes, changes, history, and even publish issues via website. 
+
+I sometimes have some merge conflict and I remembered I struggled a lot when I commited changes into my branch (not master) and one of my team mate pushed changes on the same file. When I tried to pull his changes, I got bunch of merge conflicts and I had to resolve the issue and commit again. I was just a bit nervous because I didn't want to mess up other codes. After taking this lecture, I feel much more comfortable resolving merge conflicts.

+I have never used git in depth before. The first time I used git is downloading files for SDS335 class using git pull.
+I feel like leaning git definetly has some learning curve, but once I get hang of it, I'm sure it is a powerful tool for code collaboration and big programming project.
+I am comfortable with git pull function, but I still need to work on being fluent on pushing my local repository to the remote one.
