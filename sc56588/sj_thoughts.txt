This is the first time for me to use git. I like it as it encourages cooperation between group members. It supports the members to track change and even allows to go back to a specific moment. Thus, it can prevent a human error. Because I do not have much exprience of git, I need a few trials and errors to use git well. However, this process is very interesting and I like the feeling that I learn new things.
