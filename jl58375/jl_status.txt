On branch jiyoung
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	jl_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

This implies I have a file 'jl_noadd txt' that is unknown to the remote and not on the stage. This only exists in my working directory. I can add the file to the stage via git add.
